"A study published in theBMJlooks at online supervised group physical and mental health rehabilitation programme for adults with long Covid after Covid hospitalisation.Dr Baptiste Leurent, Associate Professor in Medical Statistics, UCL, said:“This is a well conducted randomised controlled trials, and the findings appear relatively robust, although not unequivocal.  There is limited research on addressing symptoms of long covid and this study is therefore an important contribution.“The study found a 0.03 higher ‘quality-of-life’ at 3 months for those who received the rehabilitation programme, compared to standard care.  Quality-of-life is a standardised index capturing ‘overall health’, from 0 (death) and 1 (full health).  0.03 is a relatively modest effect, but could be considered sufficient to be worthwhile.","risk_communication: 1.0

These countries included Madagascar, India, Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. The researchers found a consistent pattern: infants exposed to tropical cyclones either prenatally or within their first year of life experienced a marked rise in mortality.

"The study involved 468,629 participants, all of whom had no signs of heart disease at the beginning of the research. On average, the participants were around 56 years old, and slightly more than half were women. These people were monitored for about 10 to 15 years to observe any changes in their health related to coffee consumption.

The researchers divided the participants into three groups based on how much coffee they drank each day. The first group, which made up 22.1% of the participants, did not drink coffee regularly. The second group, the largest at 58.4%, drank between half a cup and three cups per day. The final group, 19.5% of participants, drank more than three cups daily.

The results were quite surprising. People who drank coffee in light to moderate amounts (up to three cups a day) had a 12% lower risk of dying from any cause compared to those who did not drink coffee.","risk_communication: 1.0

"The authors have reported that a diet low in methionine inhibits tumour growth in mice.  This may or may not apply in humans and so before drawing any conclusions about the potential for dietary restriction as an approach to treating cancer, human studies are needed.

“The sample size is small – they had 14 mice (7 with dietary restriction and 7 without), and the type of stats analysis used may not have been suitable.  They used a parametric test which is not appropriate for such small sample sizes.  The smallest P-value you could get for a rank test with 7 in each group is 0.00058, whereas they report P = 5.71 x 10-12, which doesn’t quite make sense to me.”","risk_communication: 1.0

"The annual risk of breast cancer in this population is around 0.03%. This means that for every 1,000 people, 3 will develop breast cancer in 1 year (1000 multiplied by 0.003 [0.03% as a fraction]). If these 1,000 people increased their daily consumption of dairy foods to 80 grams – the equivalent to 6-7 tablespoons of milk, 4 to 5 tablespoons of butter or cheese – the risk may increase by 22% meaning 4 people in every 1,000 may now develop breast cancer (baseline risk 0.03% multiplied by 0.22 = 0.0066%.

This means a relative reduction (RR) of 76% (95% confidence interval 53-88%) and an absolute reduction (RD) of 3.8% (from 1.8 to 5.9%) – 38 fewer per 1000 (from 18 to 59).
