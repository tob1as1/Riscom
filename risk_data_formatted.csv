"A study published in theBMJlooks at online supervised group physical and mental health rehabilitation programme for adults with long Covid after Covid hospitalisation.Dr Baptiste Leurent, Associate Professor in Medical Statistics, UCL, said:“This is a well conducted randomised controlled trials, and the findings appear relatively robust, although not unequivocal.  There is limited research on addressing symptoms of long covid and this study is therefore an important contribution.“The study found a 0.03 higher ‘quality-of-life’ at 3 months for those who received the rehabilitation programme, compared to standard care.  Quality-of-life is a standardised index capturing ‘overall health’, from 0 (death) and 1 (full health).  0.03 is a relatively modest effect, but could be considered sufficient to be worthwhile.","risk_communication: null

Of these, over 6 million had confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses between January 2020 and December 2022. After careful matching based on age, sex, and comorbid conditions, researchers selected 3,098,948 individuals who had COVID-19 and paired them with the same number of individuals who never had the virus.Over a median follow-up period of 7 months, 286 individuals in the COVID-19 group underwent amputations, compared to only 123 in the non-infected group. This translated to a more than twofold increase in amputation risk (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.88-2.90).","risk_communication: null

Unlike prior studies that predominantly focus on static BMI measurements, this study parses individuals into distinct BMI change patterns -- most notably highlighting the ""high-increase"" group, whose BMI rises markedly over time. It is within this group that the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms increase substantially, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.61 relative to those maintaining a non-overweight BMI profile.","risk_communication: null

The trial lasted about 3.4 years. An interesting tidbit about this trial is it was stopped early because of an interim analysis that showed benefit. Ultimately, the trial showed that semaglutide compared with placebo showed a 20% risk reduction in development of a kidney-specific composite endpoint. ","risk_communication: null

That was later revised to encourage men from the ages of 55 to 69 to have a conversation with their doctor about the PSA test, and experts now generally agree that the PSA test is beneficial and that the benefits outweigh the harms of screening.

Even so, scientists have seen a roughly 4 to 6% increase each year in advanced prostate cancer diagnoses. That continued through 2018, according to data from a JAMA Network Open paper and the SEER database, when the task force revised its recommendation.

The researchers divided the participants into three groups based on how much coffee they drank each day. The first group, which made up 22.1% of the participants, did not drink coffee regularly. The second group, the largest at 58.4%, drank between half a cup and three cups per day. The final group, 19.5% of participants, drank more than three cups daily.

"In Europe, the incidence of cancer among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 39 presents a growing challenge for modern oncology. Each year, approximately 150,000 individuals in this age group are diagnosed with cancer, with Western European countries reporting a particularly high rate compared to other regions globally. Alarmingly, despite advances in oncology, survival rates for this demographic have not improved at the same pace as those observed in pediatric patients or adults over the age of 40, highlighting a critical need for tailored therapeutic strategies and enhanced treatment modalities.","risk_communication: null

The condition disproportionately affects older adults, with risk increasing significantly after age 60, but it can develop at any age.

"The research analyzed 35 patients from the United States, Israel and Taiwan with confirmed sarcoidosis and long-term occupational exposure to RCS. Sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory condition of unknown origin, is increasingly being linked to environmental and occupational exposures. However, exposure histories are rarely sought during clinical evaluation. The study's authors argue that the term silicosarcoidosis can help bridge this gap by acknowledging silica exposure as a significant and modifiable risk factor in some patients with sarcoidosis.

“The sample size is small – they had 14 mice (7 with dietary restriction and 7 without), and the type of stats analysis used may not have been suitable.  They used a parametric test which is not appropriate for such small sample sizes.  The smallest P-value you could get for a rank test with 7 in each group is 0.00058, whereas they report P = 5.71 x 10-12, which doesn’t quite make sense to me.”","risk_communication: null
