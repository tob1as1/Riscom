"Since March 2024, when bird flu was reported in US dairy cows for the first time, the virus has affected nearly 1,000 dairy cow herds and resulted in more than 70 human cases, including the first confirmed death in the country, according to the GVN.

The US poultry industry was deemed at significant risk, particularly in areas with high-density farming and where personal protective practices may be lacking, the GVN has stated.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is now circulating in all 50 states as well as in Canada, resulting in the loss or culling of more than 168 million poultry in the US alone since 2022.",

"Kennedy has refused to state unequivocally that vaccination is the only way to prevent measles. Our vaccine works so well — two doses are 97% effective against the virus — that until the three tragic deaths this year, no one in the US had died from the disease in a decade.

And yet, as cases rose to 935 across 30 states last week — a number that public health experts believe is likely a gross underestimation — Kennedy refused to acknowledge the gravity of the situation.",

Results showed that 830 patients had positive patch tests. According to the Patch Optimization Platform, which identifies which single formaldehyde-related allergen optimally captured patients with clinically relevant allergic contact dermatitis, quaternium-15 alone captured 53% of patients to the formaldehyde group. When adding formaldehyde 1% as a second allergen, 78% of patients were captured to the formaldehyde group.",

"""Without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime,"" Yon said. ""In addition to the rash, shingles has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, so we wanted to find out if getting vaccinated could lower this risk.""

Each year, approximately 150,000 individuals in this age group are diagnosed with cancer, with Western European countries reporting a particularly high rate compared to other regions globally. Alarmingly, despite advances in oncology, survival rates for this demographic have not improved at the same pace as those observed in pediatric patients or adults over the age of 40, highlighting a critical need for tailored therapeutic strategies and enhanced treatment modalities.",
"Approximately 3 million Americans currently live with glaucoma, yet remarkably, experts estimate that half remain undiagnosed.

Without proper screening and treatment, glaucoma can lead to tunnel vision and eventually total blindness—outcomes that prove especially devastating because they could often be prevented with timely intervention.",
"The research analyzed 35 patients from the United States, Israel and Taiwan with confirmed sarcoidosis and long-term occupational exposure to RCS. Sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory condition of unknown origin, is increasingly being linked to environmental and occupational exposures. However, exposure histories are rarely sought during clinical evaluation. The study's authors argue that the term silicosarcoidosis can help bridge this gap by acknowledging silica exposure as a significant and modifiable risk factor in some patients with sarcoidosis.
